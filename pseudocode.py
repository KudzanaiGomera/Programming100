#pseudocode is a simplified high-level description of a computer program or algorithm that uses plain language and logical structure. It is not actual code but is designed to be easy to read and understand by humans, particulary those with some programing knowledge. The primary goal of pseudocode is to describe the steps of an algorithm in a way that is easy to translate into actial code later.
